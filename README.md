# SIMO-Package

## Introduction

SIMO-Package is a basic NURBS-based IsoGeometric Analysis package written in MATLAB.

## Modules

* Rotation-free beam theory (Kirchhoff-Love beam theory)
* Rotation-free Kirchhoff-Love plate
* Linear Static Elasticity (including 1D, 2D, 3D elements for single patch and muti-patches problems)
* Gradient Elasticity (we are still working on it)
* IGLA (IsoGeometric Limit Analysis)
* Linear Static Heat Tranfer

## Dependencies
* Paraview (http://www.paraview.org/) for visualization
